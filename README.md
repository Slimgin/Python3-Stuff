# Python3-Stuff
Just a repo to store my Python3 stuff

These are mostly scripts to solve Python challenges like Cryptopals (https://cryptopals.com), or Python Challenge (http://www.pythonchallenge.com).

The two I wrote myself are Fibonacci/Fibonacci2 and list-int-count. Fibonacci2 will print out the the sequence until "n" condition is met. E.G. fibindex(5) will print 1, 1, 2, 3, 5. List-int-count will take output from Fibonacci2 and count the number of occurrences of each digit in the sequence.            E.G. [('1', 2), ('2', 1), ('3', 1), ('5', 1), ('0', 0), ('4', 0), ('6', 0), ('7', 0), ('8', 0), ('9', 0)]

This is kind of cool, at least to me, as it shows how the sequence grows at certain indexes.
